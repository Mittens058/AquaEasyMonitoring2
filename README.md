# AquaEasyMonitoring
Water Quality Monitoring and Control System Using ESP32 Microcontroller

**The researchers will use five sensors for the monitoring system: **

1. Gravity Analog Dissolved Oxygen Sensor SEN0237
2. Temperature Sensor DS18B20
3. pH Sensor SEN0101
4. DFRobot Analog TDS Meter SEN0244
5. Ultrasonic Sensor for water level

**The devices that will be used for the water control and depuration system are **

1. Winner Aeolus 8W Dual Air Pump
2. AquaSpeed Submersible Water Pump A2000
3. 13W UV Light Submersible Lamp
4. A servo motor will also be used for the automatic feeder.
